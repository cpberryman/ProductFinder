A web application which displays product titles and enables users to search for a product with a given title.

Files contained in 'DBadmin' are used to create a table and upload data to AWS DynamoDB. Functions in 'Controller.js' can be used to perform a Scan operation on the 'Products' database and append returned information in the 'index.html' page. 'Main.js' handles user events with functions which call the relevant 'Controller.js' function.
